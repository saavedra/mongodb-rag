You will also need:\\n- Shredded cheese (such as cheddar)\\n- Fresh toppings such as diced tomatoes, sliced onions, and chopped cilantro.\\n- Salsa, guacamole, and sour cream for serving.\\n\\nDirections:\\n1. Mix the marinade ingredients together in a bowl.\\n2. Add your beef strips into the marinade, ensuring they\\'re well coated. Let them marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes or refrigerate overnight if possible.\\n3. Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the carne asada until browned and cooked to your liking (about 5-7 minutes per side).\\n4. Warm up your taco shells in the oven, toaster oven, or microwave. \\n5. Assemble your tacos by adding carne asada, shredded cheese, fresh toppings, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.\\n\\nThis recipe should give you a dish that closely resembles an empanada with its meat filling wrapped in a crispy shell-like structure. However, if you\\'re looking for a classic Argentinian \"empanada\" type of dish, I would recommend searching specifically for traditional Argentinian empanadas which typically contain various fillings such as beef, chicken, cheese, or vegetables and are often served with chimichurri sauce. They can be baked or fried and usually have a more delicate, flaky texture from the pastry dough used.'"

Enjoy your get-together!\n",
